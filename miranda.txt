=================================
02/15/10 07:30 M - Received Arianna from Miranda.
02/17/10 17:30 W - Miranda was to receive Arianna at this time requested by her.
                   She canceled at the last moment claiming she was urgently needed at work.
02/21/10 11:00 U - Miranda called to inform me she would not be able to meet me at the 
                   arranged time and said she would reschedule later in the day.
                   I did not hear from her for the remainder of the day.

06/13/10 16:30 U - Miranda called but the call was missed. After a four month absence, I was not
                   expecting to hear from her. In the voicemail, she openly admits that she had been
                   out of town for 3.5 months and unable to make contact with me.
                 
06/14/10 18:23 M - I attempted to return Miranda's call after leaving work. There was no answer and her
                   voicemail box was full so I was unable to leave a message.
         18:39 M - She returned my call but I missed it as I was already home and working in the yard with Arianna.
                   Miranda left a voicemail but the background sounded windy and her words were unclear.

06/15/10 12:21 T - Returned Miranda's call before retrieving Arianna from preschool. Again there was no answer
                   and the voicemail box was full.
                 
         19:08 T - Miranda returned the call, which was missed as we were in the middle of dinner.
         
06/16/10 12:22 W - Called Miranda to determine if she planned to resume our normal custody schedule. There was no
                   answer and the voicemail box was full.
                   I returned Arianna home to my mother after preschool as per usual.
                   
         14:42 W - Miranda returned the call and I was able to answer. We have arranged for a transfer meeting this
                   evening at 6:15 PM.
